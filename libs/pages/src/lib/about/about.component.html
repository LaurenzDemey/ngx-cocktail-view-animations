    This application is for testing view transition api on a "real life"
    application. <b>This will not be maintained!</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    I created this application to see/fix the bottlenecks, but also to see how
    easy I could make it by hiding away functionality using directives and a
    custom router outlet. There are not a lot of examples available for Angular,
    so I saw this as a challenge! while doing so I also looked into TailwindCSS,
    the new setup of Angular (standalone, inject DI)

    Challenge 1: hook into view transition api
  </h3>
  <p>
    I didn't find any hooks hooks on the router to execute logic. I would have
    thought that the router module provided some strategy that I could
    implement, but this was not the case. I was thinking to create my own router
    logic, while I stumbled upon the idea that you can
    <b>create your own router outlet</b> directive. By doing so, I could add the
    behavior that I wanted. The only downside is that this only goes 1 level
    deep. A strategy on router configuration level would be better as there
    would be 1 orchestrator. However currently each router-outlet handles their
    own component and passes information down.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note: </b>Nested router-outlets are in this demo not supported, as the
    animation is marked as complete as 1 router outlet is finished.

    Challenge 2: Duplicate view transition name inside lists/overviews
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you have a list of items and you want to animate is separately. for
    example: the list of cocktails has each their own name and picture. Those
    are 2 different names as you want to animate it in a different way. However
    if you add a view transition name on each item with the same name then
    nothing will work as this needs to be unique. Adding a unique view
    transition name (for eaxmple by using the id) is also possible but then your
    detail page needs to be adapted to this as well. Online solution for
    different technologies did it mostly manually by writing custom javascript
    on click. while this gives flexibility, it doesn't scale well and is not
    usable if you use routerLink inside Angular. I could have created my own
    routerLink directive that would do the same thing, but I went another way by
    using another directive (vwtRepeatedTransitionContainer).
    <b
      >With this container the view transition is only applied on the elements
      where the navigation is being triggered.</b
    >
    In the custom router outlet we will look for this container and look at the
    inside to check all routerLinks to see which routes are possible. only the
    routerlink where you navigate to will be "activated" with the view
    transition name.
