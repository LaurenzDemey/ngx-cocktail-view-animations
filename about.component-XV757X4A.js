Those are 2 different names as you want to animate it in a different way. However if you add a view transition name on each item with the same name then nothing will work as this needs to be unique. Adding a unique view transition name (for eaxmple by using the id) is also possible but then your detail page needs to be adapted to this as well. Online solution for different technologies did it mostly manually by writing custom javascript on click. while this gives flexibility, it doesn't scale well and is not usable if you use routerLink inside Angular. I could have created my own routerLink directive that would do the same thing, but I went another way by using another directive (vwtRepeatedTransitionContainer).

The problem lies that the routerLinkDirective always sees this as a new route navigation event. for example going from a detail to an overview page using "routerlink=".."" will be marked as a new navigation going forward, instead of backwards. I didn't focus on this here, as it would lead me to far into what is possible.
